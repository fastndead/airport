# Airport

Welcome to the Airport repository! Here, you will find a simple implementation of an airport simulation in JavaScript. The simulation allows you to add and remove planes from a runway queue and manage their takeoff and landing times.

## How to Use

To use this implementation of the airport simulation, simply download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. The file contains a simple UI that allows you to interact with the simulation.

To add a plane to the runway queue, enter its ID, takeoff time, and landing time in the input fields at the top of the page and click the "Add Plane" button. The plane will be added to the queue and will take off or land at the specified times.

To remove a plane from the runway queue, simply click on the "Remove" button next to the plane's information in the table.
